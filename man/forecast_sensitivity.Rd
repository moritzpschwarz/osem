\title{Evaluate the sensitivity of forecasts to varying exogenous values}
\usage{
forecast_sensitivity(model, size = 0.5, quiet = FALSE, impulse_response = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object of class 'osem'.}

\item{size}{Numeric, must be larger than -1. The percentage value that the exogenous values will be multiplied with. Default is 0.5 (i.e. 50\%).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Should messages about the forecast procedure be suppressed?}

\item{impulse_response}{Logical. Should an impulse response function be calculated. Main reason to deactivate this might be improving the speed of this function.}
}
\value{
A list that contains a tibble with the original forecasts and the difference to the modified forecasts as well as plot(s).

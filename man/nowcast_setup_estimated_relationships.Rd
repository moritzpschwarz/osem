\usage{
nowcast_setup_estimated_relationships(
  model,
  i,
  exog_df_ready,
  n.ahead,
  current_spec,
  prediction_list,
  uncertainty_sample,
  nowcasted_data = NULL,
  full_exog_predicted_data = NULL,
  endog.nowcast = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object of class 'osem'.}

\item{i}{Current module that is being cycled through}

\item{exog_df_ready}{Outcome of forecast_exogenous_values() which is the set of forecasted exogenous values}

\item{n.ahead}{Periods to forecast ahead}

\item{current_spec}{The current specification for the module being forecasted}

\item{prediction_list}{The full list of all predictions. The results of the function will be saved in this list.}

\item{uncertainty_sample}{Integer. Number of draws to be made for the error bars. Default is 100.}

\item{nowcasted_data}{The full_data element of the model object resulting from the nowcasting() function. Used to substitute missing historical data.}

\item{full_exog_predicted_data}{An argument to pass a larger data.frame to the function that can contain the entire exogenously predicted data. This is an argument that is needed in the nowcasting() function.}

\item{endog.nowcast}{An indicator whether the endogenous variable has to be nowcasted before the forecast is carried out. The argument only takes dates.}
}
\value{
A list containing, among other elements, the data required to carry out the forecast for this estimated module.
